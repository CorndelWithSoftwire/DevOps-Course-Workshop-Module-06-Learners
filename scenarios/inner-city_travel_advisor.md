# Inner-City Travel Advisor 

## Brief
You work for Widget Corp. Widget Corp has a mobile app for inner-city travellers to use to advise them on what routes to take to places, including public transport. The mobile app is getting some use, but growth has died down as various issues drive users to flock to a competitor. You have been asked to propose an initial design for the next-generation version of their application.

## Research Report Summary
*The following is a summary of a report written by the research team at Widget Corp as a result of user research performed on the existing app.*

* The application received 3/5 stars on the app store. Many dissatisfied users cited "long load times when searching" as a reason for ceasing use of the app.
* We set up a stall on a street in the inner city, offering passers-by store gift cards in exchange for performing tasks on the mobile app as we recorded them. 
    * We found that a lot of users, especially tourists, would struggle to complete their tasks, as they enter names of famous monuments instead of addresses, postcodes, or road names, which are what the app is currently designed to be able to find.
    * We found that users who didn't reside in the city struggled to understand the directions for transferring between trains - the instructions currently tell you what destination train and direction to take, but many stations only signpost platform numbers.
* We conducted user interviews, and identified a few common patterns: 
    * We talked to many users who said they use the app to search for their work, and choose the same route each time, but were only really interested in seeing if there were any delays to their regular commute.
    * Users also told us that sometimes they lost track of their journey, and would find it valuable if the app kept track of their location, and notified them shortly before they needed to disembark.
    * Some users have a travel pass that covers unlimited use of some modes of travel but not others - they have asked for ways to filter routes that include only their permitted travel means. Often these are commuters who are looking to make the most of their travel pass for their leisure travel.
    * A subset of the commuters also use the app to plan travel between their meetings at different offices during the day - they would regularly open the app and enter in their destination, to make sure there were no issues and they'd be on time to their meetings.
* User telemetry indicates that at early hours of the morning (roughly 0000-0300 on Saturdays and Sundays), app usage spikes, and in many cases the app registers a lot of touches around (but not quite on) the small "Search" button. If the user doesn't hit the button correctly, they close the app after about 3 attempts on average.
