# Collaboration App

## Brief
You work for Widget Corp. Widget Corp has an existing website that allows users to book holidays - from flights to hotels to experiences. Traditionally users have booked holidays with Widget Corp for all-inclusive package deals, but increasingly they have noticed the user base booking individual aspects of the holiday, like accommodation without flights. Growth has slowed, and Widget Corp wants to invest in a new version of the application that more closely targets the needs of the new user-base that has been signing up. You have been asked to propose an initial design for this next-generation version of this application.

## Research Report Summary
*The following is a summary of a report written by the research team at Widget Corp as a result of user research performed on the existing site.*

* We invited some users to our lab to discuss how they used the application, and found:
    * Several users would browse holidays regularly throughout the year, without intentions to necessarily book anything. They were disappointed that they might miss exploring hotels that happened to be booked up for the arbitrary dates selected
    * One user returned every year to book the same hotel as a package deal
    * Some users were frustrated when the system tried to advertise convenient hotels near an airport that wasn't the airport they were flying to
* One of our account managers had a call with a travel agency that regularly books on behalf of their clients, who were annoyed that they weren't able to easily compare the same hotel booking with or without flights, instead needing to complete both journeys separately.
* We dug into our tracking analytic data, and found that conversion rates on the payment page were significantly lower for hotel-only bookings as compared to package deals. This may be related to the regular feature requests we receive for a "hold" option on hotels, to allow users to book their flights without risk of losing out.
* Online reviews often mention the same concerns:
  * Users feel worried when booking confirmation emails take longer than an hour to arrive, with some reporting times up to 24 hours.
  * Users would like a way to contact the hotel with any particular requests through the platform between booking and arrival
